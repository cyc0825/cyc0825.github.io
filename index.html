					<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
					<hr>
							<h3>"A Lost Story: Gatsby" Game Developer (Unity 2D, C#)</h3>
				
							<p>Develop a role playing 2D game that lets players be a detective to explore scenes to gather clues and figure out how to
solve one bizarre case after another. Built over 10 scenes and complex branches based on thousands of conversations and hundreds of decisions players made. Communicated with my teammates every week and got all the required scripts and the art scene.</p>
							<h3>Worldinote (SwiftUI, UIKit)</h3>
							<p>Develop an IOS app that allows users manage their photos easier by adding notes and tags. Personas: People who took lots of photos everyday and run out of space for the huge amount of photos (e.g. Students who take photos for notes during claasses). What is Hot: The app has a smooth animation and clear UI. Secret Sauce: Automatically group up pictures with the same tags and also the location the photo is taken.</p>
							<h3>NFT Publicity Web Tool Independent Project (Python, HTML)</h3>
								<p>Developed the whole frontend and backend of my NFT project publicity application from scratch. Implemented backend data server using Python Flask and built RESTFUL APIs for front end clients. Built the whole backend and all the APIs, Ex: user login, user registration, NFT preview, project timeline, NFT mint</p>
